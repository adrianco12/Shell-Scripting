# Variables and Parameters in Bash

This section explains the concepts of **variables** and **parameters** in Bash scripting.

## 🧠 Variables
Variables in Bash are used to store data that can be referenced and reused throughout a script. They can hold strings, numbers, or command outputs. Unlike many programming languages, Bash variables do not require explicit type declarations. Variable names are typically written in uppercase or lowercase letters without spaces, and their values can be changed at any point in the script. Proper variable usage allows for cleaner, more maintainable, and dynamic scripts.

## ⚙️ Parameters
Parameters refer to the values or arguments that are passed to a script when it is executed. They allow the script to accept user input or external data without modifying the script’s code. Positional parameters (such as the first, second, or third argument) are accessed by their order, while special parameters provide information about the script’s execution, such as the total number of arguments or the exit status of the last command. Parameters make Bash scripts more flexible and adaptable to different inputs and use cases.

## 📘 Summary
In Bash, variables store information within a script, while parameters provide information from outside the script. Together, they enable automation, customization, and dynamic behavior in shell scripting.
