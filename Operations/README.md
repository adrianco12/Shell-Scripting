# Understanding Operations in Bash

This repository explains **operations** in Bash scripting, which are used to perform calculations, comparisons, and logical evaluations within scripts.

## ⚙️ What Are Operations?
Operations in Bash allow scripts to perform arithmetic computations, compare values, and make logical decisions. They are essential for controlling program flow, processing input, and handling data dynamically.

## 🧮 Types of Operations

### 1. **Arithmetic Operations**
Bash supports basic mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. These operations are typically used to manipulate numerical data, counters, or perform calculations in loops and conditions.

### 2. **Comparison Operations**
Comparison operators are used to evaluate relationships between values, such as checking if two numbers or strings are equal, greater than, or less than each other. They return a true or false result, which can be used in conditional statements.

### 3. **Logical Operations**
Logical operators allow multiple conditions to be combined into complex expressions. Common logical operators include **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**, which determine how different test results are evaluated together.

### 4. **String Operations**
String operations focus on comparing, concatenating, and evaluating the properties of text values. They help manage and manipulate textual input in scripts.

## 📘 Summary
Operations in Bash form the foundation of all logical and mathematical processing. They allow scripts to calculate values, compare data, and make intelligent decisions, enabling powerful and efficient automation.
